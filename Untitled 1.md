Sure, I can try to render the math equations in a more readable format using LaTeX. Here's the explanation with the equations rendered using LaTeX:

In practice, the value function $V_\phi(s)$ in actor-critic methods like PPO is typically optimized using some form of temporal difference (TD) learning, which is closely related to minimizing mean-squared error (MSE).

Specifically, the value function parameters $\phi$ are updated to minimize the following loss function:

$$L(\phi) = \mathbb{E}[(r + \gamma V_\phi(s') - V_\phi(s))^2]$$

This loss function is simply the mean-squared TD error, where:

- $r$ is the immediate rewa
- $s'$ is the next state after taking action $a$ from $s$
- $\gamma$ is the discount factor
- $V_\phi(s)$ is the current estimated value of state $s$
- $r + \gamma V_\phi(s')$ is the TD target

Optimizing this loss function is equivalent to performing semi-gradient temporal difference learning using the TD error $\delta = r + \gamma V_\phi(s') - V_\phi(s)$ and updating $\phi$ in the direction that reduces the TD error.

The relationship to MSE becomes clear if we express the value function as approximating the true value function $V^\pi(s)$ under policy $\pi$:

$$V_\phi(s) \approx V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}[R_t + \gamma R_{t+1} + \gamma^2 R_{t+2} + \ldots \mid S_t = s]$$

Then the TD target $r + \gamma V_\phi(s')$ is a sample estimate of the true value $V^\pi(s)$. So minimizing the squared TD error is minimizing:

$$L(\phi) = \mathbb{E}[(V^\pi(s) - V_\phi(s))^2]$$

Which is exactly the mean-squared error between the approximate value function $V_\phi(s)$ and the true value function $V^\pi(s)$.

In practice, the value function is optimized by sampling transitions $(s, a, r, s')$ from the environment and updating $\phi$ using stochastic gradient descent on the TD loss:

$$\phi \gets \phi - \alpha \cdot \nabla_\phi (r + \gamma V_\phi(s') - V_\phi(s))^2$$

Where $\alpha$ is the learning rate. This incrementally reduces the MSE between $V_\phi$ and the sample-based TD targets.

Additional techniques like using n-step returns or methods like Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) in PPO provide different ways to calculate better sample-based targets in place of just $(r + \gamma V_\phi(s'))$.

But overall, value function optimization combines semi-gradient TD learning with function approximation of the value function, which is essentially minimizing mean-squared error between the approximate and true value functions.

Let me know if rendering the math equations using LaTeX in this way improves readability.
